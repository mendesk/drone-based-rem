# Drone-based Radio Environment Map

## Introduction
This repository documents my work on a research project that intends to create indoor Radio Environment Maps with the use of a drone (UAV). This work
is documented in the `docs` folder of this repository. The rest of this repository holds the code that was created to make this possible.

## Approach
1. Drone & material selection
2. [Exploring the CrazyFlie](docs/exploring_crazyflie.md)
3. [Exploring the ESP8266 WiFi module](docs/exploring_esp8266.md)
4. [Mounting the ESP8266 module on the CrazyFlie](docs/mount_esp8266.md)
5. [Adjusting the CrazyFlie's firmware for ESP8266](docs/crazyflie_firmware)
